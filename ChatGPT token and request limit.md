The **token per minute limit** for ChatGPT depends on the OpenAI API **rate limits**, which vary based on the model and the user’s subscription tier. Here's a general guide for GPT-4 (ChatGPT):

---

### **Token Limits for GPT-4 API (As of 2024)**

1. **GPT-4 (8k context):**
   - **Tokens per minute:** ~200,000 tokens/minute
   - **Requests per minute:** ~150 requests/minute

2. **GPT-4 (32k context):**
   - **Tokens per minute:** ~400,000 tokens/minute
   - **Requests per minute:** ~300 requests/minute

---

### **How Tokens per Minute Work**
- **Token Calculation:** Tokens include both input and output text.
- **Practical Example:** 
   - If each request uses 1,000 tokens (input + output), you can make around 200 requests/minute for GPT-4 (8k).
   - For GPT-4 (32k), you can make approximately 400 requests/minute.

### **Rate Limits Depend On:**
- **Subscription Tier:** Higher limits are typically available for enterprise or higher API usage plans.
- **Concurrency Limits:** Simultaneous requests are capped based on your plan.

If you’re using ChatGPT via the web app (not the API), these limits don’t apply as strictly, and you’re constrained more by model response time than explicit token limits.
