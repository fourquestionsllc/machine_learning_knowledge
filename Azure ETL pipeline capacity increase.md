To increase the capacity of your **ETL pipeline deployed in Databricks**, you need to scale each component effectively. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how to **increase the capacity** of each component:

---

### **1. Databricks Spark Streaming**
**Capacity Considerations:**
- Compute resources (worker nodes, memory, cores)
- Throughput (records per second)
- Micro-batch interval and processing latency

**How to Increase Capacity:**
- **Increase Cluster Size**: Scale up by increasing the **instance type (bigger memory/CPU)** or **scale out by adding worker nodes**.
- **Optimize Parallelism**: Increase the number of **shuffle partitions** (`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`).
- **Use Delta Lake Optimization**: Enable **autoOptimize** and **autoCompact** for better streaming write efficiency.
- **Optimize Checkpointing**: Store **checkpoint data in Azure Blob Storage or ADLS** to improve recovery times.
- **Use Auto Scaling**: Enable **Databricks autoscaling** to dynamically add or remove nodes based on demand.

---

### **2. Azure Event Hub**
**Capacity Considerations:**
- Number of partitions
- Throughput Units (TU)
- Consumer groups & concurrent readers

**How to Increase Capacity:**
- **Increase Throughput Units (TUs)**: More TUs allow higher ingestion rates.
- **Partition Scaling**: Increase the **number of partitions** to distribute load.
- **Use Batch Processing**: Instead of processing events one-by-one, increase batch size.
- **Enable Capture**: Store raw events in **Azure Blob Storage** to offload streaming pressure.

### **3. MongoDB (NoSQL)**
**Capacity Considerations:**
- Read/write throughput
- Connection limits
- Index efficiency

**How to Increase Capacity:**
- **Use Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple MongoDB instances.
- **Optimize Indexing**: Ensure indexes are optimized for query patterns.
- **Increase Read/Write Capacity**: Scale **MongoDB Atlas cluster** or configure **replica sets**.
- **Use WiredTiger Cache Optimization**: Increase **cache size** for better query performance.

---

### **4. Azure SQL Database**
**Capacity Considerations:**
- DTU (Database Transaction Units) / vCores
- Read and write throughput
- Index fragmentation and query optimization

**How to Increase Capacity:**
- **Increase Service Tier**: Upgrade to a higher **DTU/vCore tier**.
- **Enable Read Replicas**: Use **geo-replication** to distribute read traffic.
- **Partition Data**: Use **horizontal partitioning** for large tables.
- **Use Connection Pooling**: Reduce connection overhead using **Azure SQL connection pooling**.

---

### **5. Azure Cosmos DB**
**Capacity Considerations:**
- Request Units (RUs)
- Read and write latency
- Global distribution

**How to Increase Capacity:**
- **Increase RUs**: Adjust **Request Units (RUs)** dynamically.
- **Enable Multi-Region Replication**: Distribute load geographically.
- **Use Partitioning Effectively**: Choose a good partition key to prevent hot partitions.
- **Enable Indexing Optimization**: Use **custom indexing policy** for high-throughput queries.

---

### **6. Azure Synapse (Data Warehouse)**
**Capacity Considerations:**
- Dedicated SQL pool performance (DWUs)
- Query performance (distribution, caching)
- Data ingestion speed

**How to Increase Capacity:**
- **Increase DWUs (Data Warehouse Units)**: More DWUs mean faster query execution.
- **Use Materialized Views**: Precompute results for frequently accessed data.
- **Optimize Storage**: Use **columnstore indexing** for compression and faster scans.
- **Enable Query Result Caching**: Reduces compute demand for repeated queries.

---

### **7. Azure Data Factory**
**Capacity Considerations:**
- Data movement throughput
- Pipeline concurrency
- Activity execution parallelism

**How to Increase Capacity:**
- **Use Integration Runtime Scaling**: Increase number of nodes for data movement.
- **Parallel Execution**: Configure **pipeline concurrency settings**.
- **Optimize Copy Activities**: Enable **staging in Blob Storage** for large data movements.

---

### **8. Databricks Pipeline**
**Capacity Considerations:**
- Compute scaling
- Delta Lake performance
- Workflow optimization

**How to Increase Capacity:**
- **Enable Auto-Scaling**: Let Databricks manage cluster size dynamically.
- **Optimize Data Storage**: Use **Delta Lake with Z-Ordering and data compaction**.
- **Reduce Shuffle Operations**: Optimize **join strategies and data partitioning**.
- **Use Photon Engine**: Improve processing speed with **Databricks Photon**.
