In **Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning**, you have a set of **positive examples (churned customers)** and a set of **unlabeled examples (customers who have not churned yet but may churn in the future)**.

### **How to Solve This PU Learning Problem?**
Since we only have **confirmed churned customers (positives)** and **unlabeled customers (which include both future churners and non-churners)**, we need specialized techniques.

### **1. Approach 1: Two-Step PU Learning (Biased-SVM or Two-Step Classifier)**
This method treats PU learning as a two-step problem:

1. **Step 1: Identify a reliable set of negative examples (Non-Churners)**
   - Select a subset of the unlabeled data that is **highly likely** to be negative (i.e., those who are very unlikely to churn).
   - One way to do this is to use **clustering** (e.g., K-means) or an unsupervised anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest) to identify a stable set of non-churners.

2. **Step 2: Train a Binary Classifier**
   - Use the identified **positive churners** as class `1`.
   - Use the reliable **non-churners** as class `0`.
   - Train a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Use the model to predict probabilities for the remaining **unlabeled customers**.

### **2. Approach 2: Classifier with Positive and Unlabeled Data (PU Bagging)**
- Train multiple binary classifiers by treating a random subset of **unlabeled customers** as **negatives** in each iteration.
- Use **ensemble learning** (e.g., bagging) to average predictions across multiple classifiers.
- This method reduces bias introduced by incorrectly labeling some future churners as negatives.

### **3. Approach 3: Expectation-Maximization (EM) for PU Learning**
1. **Initialize:** Train a simple classifier assuming all unlabeled data is negative.
2. **Expectation Step:** Use this classifier to estimate the probability that each unlabeled instance is actually negative.
3. **Maximization Step:** Use these estimated probabilities as soft labels to re-train the model.
4. **Iterate** until convergence.

### **4. Approach 4: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection**
- Since churners might exhibit distinct behavior, you can frame this as an **anomaly detection problem** using:
  - **Autoencoders** (detect deviations in customer behavior)
  - **Isolation Forest**
  - **One-Class SVM**
- Train the model on active customers and detect **outliers** (potential future churners).

---

### **Final Prediction: Probability of Churn**
Once trained, the model will assign **churn probabilities** to each currently **unlabeled** customer. You can then set a threshold (e.g., `P(churn) > 0.7`) to flag customers for proactive retention.

### **Which Approach is Best?**
- If you have **a lot of data**, go with **PU Bagging** or **Expectation-Maximization (EM)**.
- If you need a quick & interpretable model, use **Two-Step PU Learning**.
- If your data shows clear behavioral shifts, try **Anomaly Detection**.
