The main difference between an **`async` function** and a **regular function** in Python lies in their behavior regarding asynchronous programming and how they handle concurrency.

### Key Differences Between `async` Functions and Regular Functions:

| Aspect                     | Regular Function                         | `async` Function                             |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | Defined using `def`.                    | Defined using `async def`.                  |
| **Execution**              | Runs synchronously (blocking).           | Runs asynchronously (non-blocking when awaited). |
| **Return Type**            | Returns the result of the function directly. | Returns an `awaitable` object (usually a `coroutine`). |
| **Concurrency**            | Executes sequentially; each call blocks the thread until complete. | Supports concurrent execution with the `await` keyword and the event loop. |
| **Can Use `await`?**       | No, `await` cannot be used inside a regular function. | Yes, can use `await` to pause execution and wait for an `awaitable` to complete. |
| **Usage Context**          | Ideal for CPU-bound operations or quick I/O tasks. | Ideal for I/O-bound tasks like file operations, network requests, or database queries. |
| **Example of Calling**     | Called directly like `result = func()`. | Must be awaited: `result = await async_func()` or run via `asyncio.run`. |

### Examples:

#### **Regular Function**

```python
def regular_function():
    print("Running a regular function")
    return "Done"
```

- **Execution**:
  ```python
  result = regular_function()
  print(result)  # Output: Done
  ```

- Behavior: The function runs to completion before moving to the next line of code.

---

#### **`async` Function**

```python
import asyncio

async def async_function():
    print("Running an async function")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulates a delay (non-blocking)
    return "Done"
```

- **Execution**:
  ```python
  result = asyncio.run(async_function())
  print(result)  # Output: Done
  ```

- Behavior: The function does not block the event loop while waiting for `await`able operations (e.g., `asyncio.sleep`). Other tasks in the event loop can run during the delay.

### How They Handle Concurrency

#### Regular Function:
A regular function is blocking. For example:
```python
import time

def blocking_function():
    time.sleep(2)  # Blocks the entire program
    print("Finished blocking function")

blocking_function()
print("This prints after blocking function completes")
```

#### `async` Function:
An `async` function allows for non-blocking execution:
```python
import asyncio

async def non_blocking_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Does not block the program
    print("Finished non-blocking function")

async def main():
    await non_blocking_function()
    print("This prints while other tasks can run during the delay")

asyncio.run(main())
```

---

### Summary of Use Cases:
- **Regular Functions**: Best for CPU-bound tasks or situations where concurrency is not required.
- **`async` Functions**: Ideal for I/O-bound tasks where waiting (e.g., network or file I/O) can happen concurrently, allowing better utilization of resources.
