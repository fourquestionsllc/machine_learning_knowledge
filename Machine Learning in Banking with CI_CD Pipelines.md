# **Automating Machine Learning in Banking with CI/CD Pipelines**

In the banking sector, delivering accurate, scalable, and reliable machine learning (ML) models is essential for personalized customer experiences, fraud detection, and operational efficiency. As a Machine Learning Engineer, I worked on designing and deploying CI/CD pipelines to manage the entire ML lifecycle using a robust stack of tools, including Jenkins, GitHub, Azure ML, Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), and Azure OpenAI.

This blog highlights the project’s key aspects, the technologies used, and the implementation of critical functionalities.

### **Overview of the Machine Learning Lifecycle**
The ML lifecycle in this project included:
1. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into a format suitable for ML models.
2. **Model Training and Validation:** Iteratively building, testing, and optimizing models.
3. **Model Scaling and Deployment:** Scaling models to serve predictions for millions of requests.
4. **Monitoring and Feedback Loop:** Tracking model performance and updating models based on real-time feedback.
5. **Model Drift Detection:** Identifying when models lose predictive power due to data changes.

### **Technology Stack**
1. **Jenkins & GitHub:** CI/CD automation and version control.
2. **Azure ML & Azure OpenAI:** Training, validating, and hosting ML models with integrated AI capabilities.
3. **Docker & Kubernetes:** Containerized deployments for scalability and portability.
4. **Azure Pipelines:** Orchestrating model training and deployment workflows.
5. **Monitoring Tools:** Custom scripts, Azure ML monitoring, and Prometheus.

### **CI/CD Pipeline for ML**
The project used Jenkins to orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline with GitHub repositories for version control and Azure services for cloud-based execution. Below is an example pipeline workflow.

#### **Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI)**
CI automates testing and validation of new code commits. 
Here’s a Jenkins pipeline script to lint, test, and package an ML model into a Docker container:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        DOCKER_IMAGE = 'ml_model:latest'
        DOCKER_REGISTRY = 'myacr.azurecr.io'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Unit Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest tests/'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh "docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE ."
            }
        }
        stage('Push to Registry') {
            steps {
                sh "docker login $DOCKER_REGISTRY -u username -p password"
                sh "docker tag $DOCKER_IMAGE $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE"
                sh "docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE"
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/logs/*.log'
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD)**
Once the Docker image is built, it’s deployed to Kubernetes for scalability using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Here’s a sample Kubernetes deployment manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ml-model-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ml-model
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ml-model
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ml-model
        image: myacr.azurecr.io/ml_model:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "500Mi"
            cpu: "0.5"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "1"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ml-model-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: ml-model
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 5000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

#### **Step 3: Model Monitoring and Drift Detection**
Using Azure ML monitoring, I set up alerts for data drift. Below is an example Python script for tracking model drift:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.datadrift import DataDriftDetector

# Connect to workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Create data drift detector
drift_detector = DataDriftDetector.create(
    workspace=ws,
    name='drift-detector',
    baseline_data=baseline_data,
    target_data=current_data,
    compute_target='aml-compute'
)

# Run drift detection
drift_detector.run()

# Generate drift report
report = drift_detector.get_results()
print("Drift detected:", report['data_drifted'])
```

### **Results and Insights**
- **Faster Deployments:** CI/CD pipelines reduced deployment time from weeks to hours.
- **Improved Reliability:** Automated tests ensured model accuracy and consistency.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** Docker and Kubernetes enabled seamless scaling for millions of predictions.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Drift detection ensured timely updates to maintain model performance.
