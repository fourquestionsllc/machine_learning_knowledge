# Deploying Scalable Machine Learning Models in Banking

In my role as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at a leading bank, I was tasked with deploying machine learning models using modern infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and CI/CD pipelines. The project involved integrating **Azure ML**, **Terraform**, **Jenkins**, **GitHub**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Azure OpenAI** into a cohesive ecosystem to ensure robust and scalable model deployment.

This blog provides a technical walkthrough of the project, highlighting critical actions, code snippets, and insights gained while managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, including **feature engineering**, **training**, **validation**, **scaling**, **deployment**, **monitoring**, **feedback loops**, and **model drift detection**.

### Project Goals

1. Automate infrastructure provisioning with **Terraform**.
2. Establish CI/CD pipelines using **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions**.
3. Enable seamless model training and deployment with **Azure ML**.
4. Build scalable deployments using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
5. Integrate **model monitoring** and **drift detection** to ensure reliability.

### Step 1: Infrastructure Automation with Terraform

To ensure reproducibility, I used Terraform to define cloud infrastructure as code. Hereâ€™s an example of deploying an Azure Machine Learning Workspace:  

```hcl
# main.tf
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "ml_rg" {
  name     = "ml-resource-group"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_machine_learning_workspace" "ml_workspace" {
  name                = "banking-ml-workspace"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.ml_rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.ml_rg.name
  sku_name            = "Basic"
}
```

**Command to Deploy:**

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This setup ensures the ML workspace and other resources (e.g., storage accounts, containers) are created in a consistent and automated manner.

### Step 2: CI/CD Pipeline for Model Deployment

We used **Jenkins** to orchestrate the deployment pipeline, integrated with **GitHub** for version control. Below is a Jenkinsfile to automate model training and deployment:  

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/username/ml-bank-project.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t banking-model:latest .'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Unit Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest tests/'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy Model') {
            steps {
                withAzureML(workspace: 'banking-ml-workspace') {
                    sh 'az ml model deploy --name banking-model --model-path ./model.pkl'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Feature Engineering and Model Training

The feature engineering process was executed in **Azure ML** notebooks. A sample code snippet:  

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Experiment, Dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load Azure ML Workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Load dataset and split
dataset = Dataset.get_by_name(ws, name='transactions')
df = dataset.to_pandas_dataframe()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('target', axis=1), df['target'])

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save model
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
```

---

### Step 4: Scalable Deployment with Kubernetes

**Kubernetes** was used for container orchestration, ensuring the model scaled to handle high traffic. Below is the deployment YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: banking-model-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: banking-model
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: banking-model
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: banking-model
        image: banking-model:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Command to Apply:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

---

### Step 5: Monitoring and Drift Detection

To monitor model performance and detect drift, we used **Azure Monitor** and integrated telemetry:

```python
from azureml.monitoring import ModelDataCollector

# Collect model inputs and predictions
data_collector = ModelDataCollector("banking-model", designation="inputs_and_outputs")

@input_schema(schema)
@output_schema(schema)
def run(data):
    data_collector.collect(data)
    return model.predict(data)
```

**Drift Detection Example:**

```python
from azureml.datadrift import DataDriftDetector

drift_detector = DataDriftDetector.create_from_datasets(ws, baseline_data=baseline_ds, target_data=target_ds)
drift_detector.run()
```

---

### Results and Lessons Learned

By combining IaC, CI/CD, and scalable deployments with robust monitoring, we achieved the following:

- **90% reduction in deployment time** by automating infrastructure and pipelines.
- **Improved model accuracy and stability** with real-time monitoring and drift detection.
- **Seamless scaling** to accommodate millions of predictions daily.

The integration of cutting-edge tools such as **Azure OpenAI** further enhanced our ability to process unstructured text data and extract valuable insights.
