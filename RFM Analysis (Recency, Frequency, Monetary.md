The three most important metrics often used to measure sales performance are:

1. **Recency** (Last Date):  
   Measures how recently a customer made a purchase. This helps identify active and inactive customers, showing how engaged your customer base is.

2. **Frequency** (Number of Purchases):  
   Refers to how often a customer makes purchases within a specific time frame. High frequency indicates loyal and engaged customers.

3. **Monetary Value** (Total Amount):  
   Represents the total amount spent by a customer over a period. This metric helps identify high-value customers who contribute significantly to revenue.

These three metrics form the core of **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), which is widely used in customer segmentation, sales analytics, and marketing strategies. They provide a structured way to assess customer behavior and lifetime value.
