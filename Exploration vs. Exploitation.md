### üéØ **Exploration vs. Exploitation in Reinforcement Learning**

These are **two fundamental trade-offs** in reinforcement learning that influence how an agent learns to behave optimally in an environment.

| Concept        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Exploration** | Trying **new or less-known actions** to discover their effects and rewards, even if they don't seem optimal right now. |
| **Exploitation** | Choosing the **best-known action** based on current knowledge (e.g., highest Q-value) to maximize immediate reward. |

---

### üîç Why This Trade-off Matters

- **Too much exploitation**: The agent may **miss better strategies**, because it always chooses what currently looks best and never tries alternatives.
- **Too much exploration**: The agent keeps trying random actions and **never converges** to a good policy.

The goal is to **balance both** so that the agent learns the best policy efficiently.

### üìà Example Scenario:

Imagine you're at a new food court with 10 different food stalls.

- **Exploration**: You try a new stall you've never been to, hoping to find something better.
- **Exploitation**: You keep going to the stall you already like the most.

### ü§ñ Common Exploration Strategies

- **Œµ-Greedy Policy**:
  - With probability **Œµ**, explore (pick a random action).
  - With probability **1‚àíŒµ**, exploit (choose action with highest Q-value).
  - Œµ is often decayed over time to favor exploitation more as learning progresses.

- **Softmax / Boltzmann Exploration**:
  - Choose actions **probabilistically**, giving higher-probability to higher Q-values, but still allowing suboptimal actions.

- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**:
  - Balances estimated reward and uncertainty in estimates. Often used in **multi-armed bandit problems**.

| Term            | What it Means                        | Goal |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------|
| **Exploration** | Try new actions to gain more knowledge | Discover better policies |
| **Exploitation**| Use current best-known actions        | Maximize reward now |
