Here are different **types of prompts** used in prompt engineering, categorized based on their purpose and structure:

---

### 1. **Instruction-Based Prompts**  
These prompts provide clear instructions for the model to follow.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Summarize the following article in three sentences, focusing on the main idea."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Tasks like summarization, explanations, or question-answering.

---

### 2. **Role-Based Prompts**  
The model is assigned a specific role to adopt, which influences the tone, style, and content of the output.  
- **Example**:  
   *"You are a financial advisor. Provide investment tips for someone new to the stock market."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Scenarios requiring expertise, such as technical advice, creative writing, or professional tasks.

---

### 3. **Contextual Prompts**  
Prompts where additional background or context is given to guide the model’s response.  
- **Example**:  
   *"In the year 2030, space travel has become commercial. Write a story about a family's first trip to Mars."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Creative writing, storytelling, or technical problems requiring context.

---

### 4. **Input-Output Examples (Few-Shot Prompts)**  
The model is given examples of inputs and desired outputs to set the pattern for the task.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Convert the following sentences into active voice:  
   - Input: 'The cake was eaten by John.'  
   - Output: 'John ate the cake.'  
   Now, convert: 'The project was completed by Sarah.'"*

- **Use Case**:  
   NLP tasks, such as text conversion, sentiment analysis, and formatting.

---

### 5. **Zero-Shot Prompts**  
No examples are provided; the model must rely solely on instructions.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Translate this sentence into French: 'How are you today?'"*  

- **Use Case**:  
   General tasks where the model can infer patterns directly.

---

### 6. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompts**  
Prompts that encourage step-by-step reasoning to solve a problem or explain an answer.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Solve this problem step-by-step: If a train travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, how far does it travel?"*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Math problems, logical reasoning, or complex explanations.

---

### 7. **Multi-Turn Prompts**  
Prompts designed for dialogue or multi-step interactions, often seen in conversational AI.  
- **Example**:  
   *"User: What's the weather like today?  
   Assistant: It's sunny and 75 degrees.  
   User: Should I wear a jacket?  
   Assistant: No, a light shirt will be enough for today."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Conversational systems, like chatbots.

---

### 8. **Persona-Based Prompts**  
The model adopts a specific personality, voice, or behavior.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Act as a motivational coach. Encourage me to start exercising daily."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Role-playing scenarios, personalized advice, and specific tones.

---

### 9. **Format-Specific Prompts**  
The desired output format (e.g., bullet points, tables, or code snippets) is explicitly defined.  
- **Example**:  
   *"List the benefits of exercise in bullet points."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Structured outputs like lists, tables, or code.

---

### 10. **Delimiters-Based Prompts**  
Delimiters (like `"""` or `<>`) are used to clearly define input, instructions, or boundaries.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Summarize the text between the triple quotes:  
   \"\"\"  
   Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries...  
   \"\"\" "*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Tasks requiring clear separation of input and instructions.

---

### 11. **Iterative Refinement Prompts**  
Prompts that ask the model to refine or improve previous outputs.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Revise the following paragraph to make it more concise while keeping the key points intact."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Editing, revising, and improving generated content.

---

### 12. **Interactive Prompts**  
Prompts that enable step-by-step collaboration with the model.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Let's write a story together. I'll start: 'Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom...'. Now, you continue."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Collaborative creative tasks or multi-turn tasks.

---

### 13. **Coding Prompts**  
Prompts designed for programming-related tasks.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Code generation, debugging, or explanation.

---

### 14. **Visual or Multimodal Prompts**  
Prompts that involve text and visual inputs (for models supporting image input).  
- **Example**:  
   *"Describe the content of this image and suggest a relevant caption."*  

- **Use Case**:  
   Tasks requiring vision-language understanding.

---

### 15. **Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought Prompts**  
Combines **few-shot learning** with **step-by-step reasoning**.  
- **Example**:  
   *"Here is an example:  
   Q: There are 5 apples, and you take away 3. How many are left?  
   A: Step 1: There were 5 apples originally.  
   Step 2: I took away 3 apples.  
   Step 3: 5 - 3 = 2 apples.  
   Final Answer: 2 apples.  
   Now solve: There are 12 oranges, and you take away 7. How many are left?"*

- **Use Case**:  
   Complex reasoning tasks, math, and problem-solving.

By combining these prompt types strategically, you can tailor responses for a variety of applications—NLP tasks, content creation, code generation, or reasoning-based tasks.
