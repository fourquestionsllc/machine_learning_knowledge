For CI/CD automation of ML inference pipelines from pre-deployment to deployment, we use the GraphQL API to manage object creation, pipeline orchestration, and environment transitions. The GraphQL API runs within our CI/CD pipeline, typically executed in a GitHub Actions or Jenkins job. Upon merging changes to the main branch, the API triggers pipeline deployments, promoting workflows from pre-deployment to production workspaces. It updates configurations, assigns versioned models, and ensures metadata tagging for tracking. Post-deployment, inference results are streamed to Arize AI for monitoring. The API also validates deployment integrity by checking model performance against predefined benchmarks before finalizing production rollout.
