**A\/B Testing** (also known as **split testing**) is a method to compare two versions of something to determine which one performs better.

## 🧪 **What is A/B Testing?**

A/B testing involves:

* **A** = Control (the current version)
* **B** = Variant (a modified version)
* Users are **randomly split** into two groups.
* You measure which version achieves the **desired outcome better** (e.g., higher click-through rate, conversions, engagement, etc.).

## 📊 **Real-World Example**

You're testing two versions of a **signup button** on a website:

| Group | Button Text   | Users | Signups | Conversion Rate |
| ----- | ------------- | ----- | ------- | --------------- |
| A     | "Sign Up Now" | 1000  | 50      | 5%              |
| B     | "Join Free"   | 1000  | 80      | 8%              |

✅ **Winner:** Variant B — Higher conversion rate

## ⚙️ **How A/B Testing Works**

1. **Define the Goal** — What metric are you improving? (e.g., sales, clicks)
2. **Identify the Variable** — What are you testing? (e.g., headline, image, CTA)
3. **Split Users Randomly** — 50% get version A, 50% get B.
4. **Collect Data** — Measure performance on both versions.
5. **Analyze Results** — Use statistical tests to confirm significance.
6. **Deploy the Winner** — Apply the better-performing variant.

## 📐 **Key Metrics**

* **Conversion Rate**
* **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**
* **Bounce Rate**
* **Time on Page**
* **Revenue per Visitor**

---

## 🧠 **Best Practices**

* Test **one variable at a time** (to isolate the effect).
* Run tests long enough to reach **statistical significance**.
* Use **random assignment** to avoid bias.
* Be wary of **false positives** — always validate with data.

## 🧰 **Tools for A/B Testing**

* Google Optimize (retired but was popular)
* Optimizely
* VWO
* Adobe Target
* Mixpanel / Amplitude (for analytics-based A/B)
* LaunchDarkly / Split.io (feature flagging for testing)

## ✅ **Use Cases**

* Changing CTA buttons
* Different landing page layouts
* Email subject lines
* Pricing strategies
* App onboarding flows
* Recommendation algorithms
