When a dataset is too large to fit into memory, you can use the following strategies for **data scaling** and **machine learning training**:

---

### **1. Use Batch Processing**
Instead of loading the entire dataset into memory, process it in smaller batches:
- **Tools**: Use libraries like **Dask**, **Pandas** (with chunks), or **PySpark** for batch processing.
- Example in Pandas:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  for chunk in pd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv', chunksize=10000):
      # Scale and process each chunk
      scaled_chunk = (chunk - chunk.mean()) / chunk.std()
  ```

---

### **2. Incremental Learning**
Use machine learning algorithms that support **online learning** or **partial_fit** to process data in chunks:
- **Scikit-Learn**: Use models like `SGDClassifier`, `SGDRegressor`, or any model with `partial_fit`.
- Example:
  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
  model = SGDClassifier()
  for chunk in pd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv', chunksize=10000):
      X, y = chunk.iloc[:, :-1], chunk.iloc[:, -1]
      model.partial_fit(X, y, classes=[0, 1])  # Provide all possible classes
  ```

---

### **3. Scale Data Incrementally**
Apply scaling techniques like **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler** in batches:
- Scikit-Learn supports incremental scaling with `partial_fit`.
- Example:
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  for chunk in pd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv', chunksize=10000):
      scaler.partial_fit(chunk)  # Compute scaling factors incrementally
  ```

  After computing the scaling factors, transform the data in batches:
  ```python
  for chunk in pd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv', chunksize=10000):
      scaled_chunk = scaler.transform(chunk)
      # Use scaled_chunk for training
  ```

---

### **4. Distributed Computing**
For very large datasets, distributed computing frameworks can handle data processing:
- **Apache Spark**: Use MLlib for distributed machine learning.
  ```python
  from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
  from pyspark.ml.feature import StandardScaler
  spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("LargeData").getOrCreate()
  data = spark.read.csv('large_dataset.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)
  scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features", outputCol="scaledFeatures")
  scaled_data = scaler.fit(data).transform(data)
  ```
- **Dask**: Scales Python-based workflows for large data.

---

### **5. Data Streaming**
Stream the dataset during training using frameworks like:
- **TensorFlow**: Use `tf.data` API to create data pipelines.
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  dataset = tf.data.TextLineDataset('large_dataset.csv').batch(1000)
  for batch in dataset:
      # Process and train on each batch
  ```
- **PyTorch**: Use `DataLoader` to load data incrementally.

---

### **6. Feature Engineering with Sampling**
If scaling the full dataset isn't feasible:
- Use a representative **sample** of the data for scaling (e.g., 1%).
- Apply scaling factors to the entire dataset during processing.

---

### **7. Use External Storage for Processing**
Store data in external systems and access it in chunks:
- **Databases**: Query data from relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- **Big Data Systems**: Use tools like Amazon S3, HDFS, or Google BigQuery.

---

### **8. Consider Specialized Libraries**
Libraries designed for large-scale data processing:
- **H2O.ai**: Supports training ML models on distributed systems.
- **Vaex**: Handles out-of-core dataframes for large datasets.

---

By leveraging incremental learning, batch processing, and distributed systems, you can scale large datasets effectively without loading everything into memory.
