To merge the branch `release/1.0` of a GitHub repository into another branch `release/1.1`, you can follow these steps:

---

### Steps to Merge Branch `release/1.0` into `release/1.1`

#### 1. **Ensure You Are in the Correct Repository**
Navigate to the repository's local clone directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/repository
```

#### 2. **Fetch the Latest Changes**
Ensure your local repository is up-to-date with the remote:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

#### 3. **Check Out the Target Branch**
Switch to the branch you want to merge into (`release/1.1`):
```bash
git checkout release/1.1
```

#### 4. **Merge the Source Branch**
Merge `release/1.0` into `release/1.1`:
```bash
git merge release/1.0
```

If there are no conflicts, the merge will complete successfully.

#### 5. **Handle Merge Conflicts (If Any)**
If conflicts arise:
1. Git will notify you about the files with conflicts.
2. Open the conflicted files, resolve the conflicts, and remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
3. Stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```
4. Continue the merge by committing:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

#### 6. **Push the Changes to the Remote Repository**
Once the merge is complete, push the changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin release/1.1
```

---

### Example
```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd my-repo

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Switch to the target branch
git checkout release/1.1

# Merge the source branch
git merge release/1.0

# If conflicts arise, resolve them, then commit
git add .
git commit

# Push changes to the remote
git push origin release/1.1
```

---

### Notes
- Ensure you have write permissions to the `release/1.1` branch.
- If you donâ€™t want to commit the merge yet, you can use:
  ```bash
  git merge --no-commit release/1.0
  ```
  This will perform the merge but leave the changes uncommitted, allowing you to review and modify them before committing.
