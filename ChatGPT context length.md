The context length of ChatGPT varies depending on the version you're using:

1. **ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)**:
   - The context length is **4,096 tokens**.
   - Tokens include input text and the model's responses. (Roughly 1 token ≈ 4 characters of English text.)

2. **ChatGPT (GPT-4)**:
   - Available in two context-length variants:
     - **8,192 tokens** (default for most applications).
     - **32,768 tokens** (available in GPT-4-turbo for extended use cases).

### Notes on Context Length:
- **Definition of Tokens**: Tokens are pieces of text; for example, "ChatGPT" is 2 tokens ("Chat" and "GPT").
- **Practical Implications**: The total number of tokens in a conversation (including system instructions, user input, and model output) cannot exceed the model's limit.
- **Use Cases for Longer Contexts**: The extended context in GPT-4 makes it ideal for analyzing long documents, maintaining continuity in extended conversations, or processing complex tasks.

ChatGPT-4 (also referred to as GPT-4) has the following context length options:

1. **8,192 Tokens** (Default):
   - This is the standard context length available for most GPT-4 instances.
   - Suitable for medium-length conversations or documents.

2. **32,768 Tokens** (Extended Context):
   - Available in **GPT-4-turbo**.
   - Ideal for handling long documents, in-depth analysis, or extensive interactions.

### Key Points About Context Length
- **Token Breakdown**: Both input (your prompt) and output (model's response) count toward the token limit.
- **Token Estimation**: 1 token ≈ 4 characters of English text, so 32,768 tokens translate to roughly 24,000–25,000 words.
- **Usage Scenarios**:
  - The 8,192-token limit is sufficient for most general-purpose applications.
  - The 32,768-token limit is optimal for large-scale document processing, like summarization, legal text review, or research analysis.

If you are working on a specific use case that requires large context lengths, leveraging the extended version is recommended. Would you like guidance on adapting prompts to fit within these limits?
