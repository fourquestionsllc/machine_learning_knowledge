> **“Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness or creativity of the output generated by a language model. It directly affects how the model samples from the probability distribution of possible next tokens.”**

### 🔥 **Concept of Temperature**

* **Definition:**
  Temperature adjusts the **softmax distribution** of token probabilities.
  The formula is:

  $$
  P_{i} = \frac{e^{\frac{z_i}{T}}}{\sum_j e^{\frac{z_j}{T}}}
  $$

  Where $T$ is temperature and $z_i$ are logits (raw scores).

### ⚖️ **How It Affects Output**

| Temperature | Behavior                                           | Use Case                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `0`         | Deterministic (always chooses highest probability) | Factual tasks, reasoning, QA    |
| `0.3–0.7`   | Balanced — some variation but still focused        | Chatbots, summarization         |
| `> 0.7`     | Creative and diverse (more randomness)             | Story generation, brainstorming |
| `1.5+`      | Very random, often incoherent                      | Rarely useful                   |

### 🛠 **Practical Example**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a poem about AI"}],
    temperature=1.0  # More creative
)
```

### 🎯 **Why It Matters in Practice**

* **Lower temperature** = more factual, reliable, ideal for RAG or SQL generation.
* **Higher temperature** = more diverse and surprising responses.
* In **multi-agent systems**, I often tune temperature **per agent** — e.g., a researcher might use 0.8, but a planner uses 0.2 for stability.

> “So, in summary, temperature is key for balancing **creativity vs reliability**. I typically keep it low in factual applications like RAG, and raise it for brainstorming or content generation.”
