> **“To evaluate a RAG pipeline, I break it down into evaluating the retrieval and the generation separately, and then jointly. The goal is to ensure the system returns accurate, relevant, and grounded responses. Here’s how I do it:”**

---

### ✅ **1. Evaluate Retrieval Component**

**Goal:** Check if relevant context is retrieved.

* **Recall\@k / Precision\@k**

  * Measure how often the ground-truth answer appears in top-k retrieved chunks.
  * Useful when gold answers or supporting documents are available.

* **Embedding similarity inspection**

  * Manually review vector matches to see if semantically relevant chunks are surfaced.

* **Overlap with gold context**

  * Compute token overlap between retrieved context and known good passages.

* **Diversity check**

  * Ensure retrieval isn’t dominated by one doc; check coverage across documents.

```python
# Example: Precision@k (pseudo)
correct_hits = sum(1 for chunk in top_k_chunks if answer_text in chunk)
precision = correct_hits / k
```

---

### ✅ **2. Evaluate Generation Quality**

**Goal:** Ensure the answer is grounded, fluent, and accurate.

* **Human Evaluation Criteria**
  Score generated answers based on:

  * **Faithfulness (Factual grounding)** – Does it stay true to the context?
  * **Relevance** – Does it answer the actual user query?
  * **Completeness** – Is the answer thorough enough?
  * **Fluency** – Is it grammatically and stylistically sound?

* **Automated LLM-as-a-Judge**
  Use GPT-4 or Claude to rate the generated answer against ground truth.

```python
# LLM judge prompt template
Evaluate this answer:
Q: <question>
A: <generated_answer>
Context: <retrieved_chunks>
Give a score from 1-5 and justify.
```

* **QA-based Evaluation (Answer Extraction)**

  * Use a QA model (e.g., GPT-4) to re-answer the question using retrieved context.
  * Compare that answer to the RAG output for similarity (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.).

---

### ✅ **3. Evaluate End-to-End RAG System**

**Goal:** Assess the full pipeline in real user scenarios.

* **Exact Match / F1 (if gold answers exist)**

* **Hallucination rate**

  * % of answers containing unsupported or false claims.

* **Groundedness score**

  * Use tools like **RAGAS**, **TruLens**, or **LangChain’s eval module** to evaluate:

    * Does every generated statement trace back to retrieved context?

* **User feedback**

  * Collect real users’ confidence or satisfaction scores.

---

### 🛠 Tools & Frameworks I Use

* **RAGAS**: End-to-end RAG eval including answer correctness and faithfulness
* **TruLens**: Open-source framework to evaluate LLM apps (faithfulness, relevance, etc.)
* **LangChain Evals / LlamaIndex evals**
* **OpenAI GPT-4 / Claude LLM-as-a-judge**
* **Embedding visualizations** (e.g., t-SNE) to debug retrieval quality

### 🧠 Example Evaluation Criteria Summary

| Metric          | Component  | Method                              |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Precision\@k    | Retrieval  | Check if relevant docs are in top-k |
| Faithfulness    | Generation | LLM-as-a-judge or human review      |
| Hallucination % | Generation | Check unsupported claims            |
| Groundedness    | Full RAG   | Trace answers to sources            |
| EM / F1         | Full RAG   | Compare to gold answers             |
