Comparison between **FastAPI** and **Flask**
---

### ‚úÖ **Quick Summary**

> **‚ÄúFastAPI is a modern, async-ready web framework designed for performance and type safety. Flask is a classic, synchronous web framework known for simplicity and flexibility. Both are used for building APIs, but FastAPI is better for modern async, data validation, and auto docs out of the box.‚Äù**

### üîç **Detailed Comparison Table**

| Feature                  | **FastAPI**                                        | **Flask**                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**          | Very high (async support, based on ASGI + Uvicorn) | Slower (sync WSGI-based)                    |
| **Async Support**        | Native `async/await` support                       | Not native; needs extra setup (e.g., Quart) |
| **Data Validation**      | Built-in with **Pydantic**                         | Manual (e.g., with Marshmallow or WTForms)  |
| **Type Safety**          | Strong (uses Python type hints)                    | Weak (no built-in support)                  |
| **Auto Documentation**   | Yes (Swagger & ReDoc from OpenAPI schema)          | No (requires plugins like Flask-RESTX)      |
| **Request Parsing**      | Automatic from model types                         | Manual via `request.get_json()`             |
| **Community & Maturity** | Newer (\~2018), growing fast                       | Mature (\~2010), very large ecosystem       |
| **Learning Curve**       | Slightly steeper due to type hints & async         | Very beginner-friendly                      |
| **Deployment**           | ASGI (Uvicorn, Hypercorn)                          | WSGI (Gunicorn, uWSGI)                      |
| **Use Cases**            | Modern APIs, ML inference, microservices           | Simple web apps, REST APIs                  |

### üß† Real-World Example

> "I used **Flask** early in my career for simple web apps and API backends. But as I moved to ML model serving and async GenAI tools, **FastAPI** became my default due to built-in request validation with **Pydantic**, fast async routes, and OpenAPI docs without extra setup."

### üß™ Code Comparison

**Flask Example:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/predict", methods=["POST"])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    result = some_model.predict([data["x"], data["y"]])
    return jsonify({"result": result})
```

**FastAPI Example:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Input(BaseModel):
    x: float
    y: float

@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(input: Input):
    result = some_model.predict([[input.x, input.y]])
    return {"result": result}
```

### üèÅ When to Use What?

* **Use FastAPI if**:

  * You need async performance
  * You care about automatic docs and validation
  * You're building scalable GenAI/ML services

* **Use Flask if**:

  * You want a minimal, lightweight setup
  * You're building small apps or prototyping quickly
  * You already use Flask and don‚Äôt need async features
