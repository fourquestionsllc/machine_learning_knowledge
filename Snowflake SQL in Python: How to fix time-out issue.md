Running a SQL query that takes a few hours in Snowflake but times out when using the Python wrapper of Pandas is a common challenge. Here's how you can address this issue:

### Steps to Fix the Timeout Issue

#### 1. **Optimize the Query**
   - Review the query and ensure itâ€™s optimized for Snowflake. 
   - Use techniques like:
     - Reducing the number of joins and subqueries.
     - Adding appropriate filters (`WHERE` clauses) to limit the data being processed.
     - Using Snowflake clustering keys for faster querying.
     - Leveraging Snowflake's result caching.

#### 2. **Increase Timeout in the Python Connection**
   - You can increase the timeout when connecting to Snowflake using the Python Snowflake connector. 
   - Example:
     ```python
     import snowflake.connector
     import pandas as pd

     conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
         user='your_username',
         password='your_password',
         account='your_account',
         database='your_database',
         schema='your_schema',
         warehouse='your_warehouse',
         role='your_role',
         autocommit=True,
         network_timeout=3600  # Set timeout in seconds
     )

     query = "YOUR_LONG_RUNNING_QUERY"
     df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
     ```

#### 3. **Use Snowflake's `CREATE TABLE AS` or `COPY INTO`**
   - Run the query in Snowflake to save the results into a table and then fetch the table data in chunks.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE your_temp_table AS SELECT * FROM your_complex_query;
     ```

     Then fetch the data:
     ```python
     query = "SELECT * FROM your_temp_table"
     chunks = pd.read_sql(query, conn, chunksize=100000)
     for chunk in chunks:
         # Process each chunk
     ```

#### 4. **Fetch Data in Chunks**
   - If the query result is large, fetch it in chunks to avoid memory and time constraints.
     ```python
     for chunk in pd.read_sql(query, conn, chunksize=100000):  # Adjust chunksize as needed
         # Process the chunk
     ```

#### 5. **Run Query Asynchronously**
   - Use the Snowflake query ID to monitor long-running queries and retrieve results later.
     ```python
     cursor = conn.cursor()
     cursor.execute("YOUR_LONG_RUNNING_QUERY")

     # Get the query ID
     query_id = cursor.sfqid
     print(f"Query is running with ID: {query_id}")

     # Fetch results once the query completes
     cursor.get_results_from_sfqid(query_id)
     df = cursor.fetch_pandas_all()
     ```

#### 6. **Increase Warehouse Size**
   - Temporarily increase the Snowflake warehouse size to handle the query faster.
     ```sql
     ALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE';
     ```

#### 7. **Save Data to External Storage**
   - Export the data to an external storage location (e.g., AWS S3) and process it locally.
     ```sql
     COPY INTO 's3://your-bucket/' FROM your_query;
     ```

     Then, use Pandas to read the data:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv('s3://your-bucket/your-data.csv')
     ```

### Debugging Tips
- Check Snowflake's query history for performance bottlenecks.
- Review the logs for timeout or resource constraints.
- Test the query interactively in Snowflake to estimate execution time.
