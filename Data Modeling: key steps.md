Data modeling is the **blueprint of your analytics/data platform**, and doing it well ensures your data is **organized, scalable, performant**, and **easy to understand**. Here's a breakdown of the **key steps of data modeling**, especially in the context of tools like dbt and modern analytics stacks:

---

## 🧱 1. Understand Business Requirements

**Goal**: Know what questions the business wants to answer.

- Talk to stakeholders (analysts, product, ops)
- Define KPIs: e.g., "safe driver score", "trip count per policyholder"
- Understand data sources: GPS logs, vehicle events, user profiles

🔍 _Example_: GEICO wants to know which drivers are most at risk based on telematics data.

---

## 🧼 2. Explore and Profile Raw Data

**Goal**: Understand what you're working with.

- Look at raw tables, schemas, sample rows
- Identify nulls, data types, anomalies
- Understand grain of each table (e.g., trip-level, GPS point-level)

🧰 Tools: dbt sources, SQL, data profiling in warehouse/BI tools

---

## 📦 3. Define the Layers of Your Model

**Goal**: Create a clear transformation pipeline. In dbt, the layers are often:

1. **Staging** (`stg_`): Clean and rename raw columns (1:1 mapping)
2. **Intermediate / Business Logic** (`int_`): Join and derive logic (e.g., calculate trip duration)
3. **Marts / Final Models** (`fct_`, `dim_`):
   - **Facts**: transactional data like trips, events
   - **Dimensions**: entities like drivers, vehicles

💡 _Tip_: Use the [**dim-fact** modeling pattern](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/building-a-dbt-project#dimensional-modeling).

---

## 🧮 4. Define Keys, Grain, and Joins

**Goal**: Avoid duplication and maintain integrity.

- **Primary key** for each model (e.g., `trip_id`, `user_id`)
- Decide the **grain** (e.g., 1 row per trip)
- Create clean joins between tables (e.g., trip joins GPS on `device_id` and timestamp range)

---

## 🧪 5. Add Tests and Documentation

**Goal**: Ensure data quality and trust.

- Add `not_null`, `unique`, and relationship tests in dbt
- Write YAML docs for each model and column

🧪 Example:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: trip_id
    description: "Unique ID of the trip"
    tests:
      - not_null
      - unique
```

---

## 🔄 6. Run, Iterate, and Validate

**Goal**: Validate models with stakeholders.

- `dbt run`, check output
- Compare with known reports or expectations
- Iterate until KPIs align

📈 _Tip_: Use BI tools (Looker, Tableau, Power BI) to validate against dashboards

---

## 🧠 7. Optimize & Refactor

**Goal**: Improve performance and maintainability.

- Materialize heavy models as tables
- Refactor repeated logic into macros or CTEs
- Use dbt packages for common transformations
