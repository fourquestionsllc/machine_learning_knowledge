### **Differences Among Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analysis**  

| Model Type       | Purpose | Techniques Used | Example Use Cases |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Descriptive Analytics** | Understand past and present trends by analyzing historical data. | Data aggregation, statistical analysis, data visualization, clustering | - Sales trend analysis in retail. <br> - Customer segmentation based on past purchases. <br> - Inventory turnover rate analysis. |
| **Predictive Analytics** | Forecast future outcomes based on historical data. | Machine learning, regression, time series forecasting, deep learning | - Demand forecasting for supply chain optimization. <br> - Credit risk assessment in banking. <br> - Predicting equipment failure in manufacturing. |
| **Prescriptive Analytics** | Provide actionable recommendations to optimize decision-making. | Optimization algorithms (LP, MIP, QP, CP), reinforcement learning, decision trees | - Route optimization for logistics. <br> - Dynamic pricing strategies in e-commerce. <br> - Inventory replenishment optimization. |

### **Example in Supply Chain Optimization**  
- **Descriptive:** Analyze past shipping delays and identify bottlenecks in the supply chain.  
- **Predictive:** Forecast future demand for products based on historical sales data.  
- **Prescriptive:** Recommend optimal warehouse locations and transportation routes to minimize costs.
