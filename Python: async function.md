In Python, you can create and use an asynchronous function (also called an `async` function) using the `async def` syntax. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Define an `async` function**
An `async` function is defined using the `async def` keyword. Inside this function, you can use `await` to call other asynchronous functions.

```python
import asyncio

async def greet(name):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate a delay
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

- `asyncio.sleep(1)` is used to simulate an asynchronous delay.
- You must `await` any other asynchronous functions within an `async` function.

### 2. **Call an `async` function**

#### Option 1: Use `asyncio.run` (Recommended)
The simplest way to run an `async` function is to use `asyncio.run`. This is available in Python 3.7+.

```python
result = asyncio.run(greet("Alice"))
print(result)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

#### Option 2: Use an Event Loop (Advanced)
You can also manually manage the event loop.

```python
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(greet("Bob"))
print(result)  # Output: Hello, Bob!

# Note: This method is less commonly used, and `asyncio.run` is preferred.
```

### 3. **Calling multiple `async` functions concurrently**

If you have multiple `async` functions, you can use `asyncio.gather` to run them concurrently.

```python
async def main():
    task1 = greet("Alice")
    task2 = greet("Bob")
    task3 = greet("Charlie")
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2, task3)
    print(results)  # Output: ['Hello, Alice!', 'Hello, Bob!', 'Hello, Charlie!']

asyncio.run(main())
```

---

### Key Points:
- `async def` defines an asynchronous function.
- Use `await` to call other asynchronous functions inside an `async` function.
- Use `asyncio.run` to execute an `async` function.
- To run multiple tasks concurrently, use `asyncio.gather`.
