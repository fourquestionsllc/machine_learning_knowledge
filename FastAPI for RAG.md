To create a FastAPI-based API that handles a typical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, we need to follow these general steps:

1. **Input**: A question from the user.
2. **Process**:
    - **Retrieve** relevant documents based on the input question.
    - **Generate** an answer based on the retrieved document(s).
3. **Output**: The relevant document content, the page number(s), and the answer.

The RAG pipeline usually involves two major components:
- **Retrieval**: A mechanism to find relevant documents given a question (using something like Elasticsearch, BM25, FAISS, etc.).
- **Generation**: A generative model like GPT-3 or T5 that answers based on the retrieved documents.

In this case, I’ll show how to implement this with a basic example. You can later swap in a real retrieval mechanism like FAISS or Elasticsearch and a more powerful model for generation.

We’ll implement the API in a simple way using **FAISS** for document retrieval and **OpenAI GPT-3** for the generation step.

### 1. Install Dependencies

You will need FastAPI, Uvicorn, FAISS, and OpenAI API client.

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai faiss-cpu numpy
```

You also need to set up an OpenAI API key for the GPT model.

### 2. FastAPI Application Setup

#### `main.py` (FastAPI API)

```python
import openai
import numpy as np
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import faiss
import pickle

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# OpenAI API Key (make sure to set your own key in your environment or config)
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

# Define request and response models
class QuestionRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str

class QuestionResponse(BaseModel):
    relevant_document: str
    page_number: int
    answer: str

# Load FAISS index and document data (from a preprocessed index)
# For the sake of example, we use a simple preloaded FAISS index and sample documents
# In practice, you will load your FAISS index and document list here
with open("faiss_index.pkl", "rb") as f:
    faiss_index, documents = pickle.load(f)

# FAISS retrieval function
def retrieve_documents(query: str, top_k: int = 3):
    # Convert the query to an embedding vector (simple dummy embedding for example)
    query_embedding = np.random.random((1, 768)).astype("float32")  # This should be your actual query embedding

    # Perform the search in FAISS
    distances, indices = faiss_index.search(query_embedding, top_k)

    retrieved_docs = []
    for i in range(top_k):
        retrieved_docs.append((documents[indices[0][i]], indices[0][i] + 1))  # document text and page number

    return retrieved_docs

# Answer generation function using OpenAI API
def generate_answer(question: str, retrieved_docs: list):
    # Combine retrieved documents into context for the model
    context = "\n".join([doc[0] for doc in retrieved_docs])
    prompt = f"Question: {question}\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nAnswer:"

    # Call OpenAI API for answer generation
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return answer

# API endpoint to handle the question and return relevant documents and answer
@app.post("/ask", response_model=QuestionResponse)
async def answer_question(request: QuestionRequest):
    question = request.question

    # Step 1: Retrieve relevant documents using FAISS (or any other retrieval mechanism)
    retrieved_docs = retrieve_documents(question)

    if not retrieved_docs:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="No relevant documents found")

    # Step 2: Generate the answer based on the retrieved documents using GPT (or any other generative model)
    answer = generate_answer(question, retrieved_docs)

    # Step 3: Extract the first relevant document and page number as output
    relevant_document, page_number = retrieved_docs[0]

    return QuestionResponse(
        relevant_document=relevant_document,
        page_number=page_number,
        answer=answer
    )
```

### 3. Explanation of Code

1. **Retrieving Documents (FAISS)**:
   - We use a **FAISS index** to retrieve documents related to the input question. The documents are pre-processed and stored in a FAISS index (you can build this using actual document embeddings).
   - The `retrieve_documents()` function uses FAISS to retrieve the most relevant documents based on the query. The retrieved documents include the text and page number.

2. **Generating Answers (OpenAI GPT-3)**:
   - Once relevant documents are retrieved, we concatenate them and use **OpenAI's GPT-3 model** to generate an answer based on the provided context (retrieved documents).

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - The FastAPI endpoint `/ask` accepts a `question` and responds with a relevant document, the page number from the document, and the generated answer.

### 4. Running the FastAPI Server

To run the FastAPI application, execute the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 5. Example of FAISS Index & Documents

You will need to create and save a **FAISS index** (`faiss_index.pkl`) for document retrieval. Here is an example of how you can create a simple FAISS index with embeddings (you can replace the random vectors with actual document embeddings from models like BERT, Sentence-BERT, etc.):

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np
import pickle

# Dummy data (replace with actual document texts and embeddings)
documents = [
    "This is the content of document 1. It talks about AI.",
    "This document discusses machine learning techniques.",
    "This is a document about deep learning with neural networks."
]

# Generate random embeddings for documents (replace with actual embeddings)
document_embeddings = np.random.random((len(documents), 768)).astype("float32")

# Create FAISS index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(768)  # L2 distance metric for similarity search
index.add(document_embeddings)

# Save the FAISS index and document data
with open("faiss_index.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump((index, documents), f)
```

### 6. Example of API Usage

- **Request**: A `POST` request to `/ask` with a question in the body:
```json
{
  "question": "What is AI?"
}
```

- **Response**:
```json
{
  "relevant_document": "This is the content of document 1. It talks about AI.",
  "page_number": 1,
  "answer": "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which involves creating machines capable of intelligent behavior."
}
```

### 7. Notes

- **Document Embeddings**: In a production RAG pipeline, you would replace the dummy embeddings with actual embeddings generated from models like BERT, Sentence-BERT, or any other suitable model for your documents.
- **OpenAI Integration**: This example uses OpenAI's GPT-3 for generating answers, but you can substitute it with any other generative model that suits your use case.
- **Performance Considerations**: FAISS provides an efficient similarity search, but for very large datasets, consider optimizing the retrieval step (e.g., using FAISS with disk storage or more advanced retrieval models).

This setup should help you get started with creating an API that handles the RAG pipeline in FastAPI.
