In **AutoGen**, orchestrating agents refers to designing workflows where multiple agents interact collaboratively to perform tasks. Each agent is designed for a specific purpose, such as reasoning, generating content, querying tools, or collaborating with other agents.

Hereâ€™s an example of orchestrating agents in **AutoGen**, where a **UserAgent** interacts with multiple assistants to solve a task:

---

### **Scenario**
You want to analyze customer feedback and provide actionable insights. This involves:
1. **AssistantAgent 1**: Summarizing feedback.
2. **AssistantAgent 2**: Extracting positive and negative sentiment.
3. **Orchestration**: Coordinating their tasks.

---

### **Code Example: Orchestrating Agents**

#### **Install AutoGen**
```bash
pip install autogen
```

#### **Example Script**
```python
from autogen import UserAgent, AssistantAgent, Dialogue

# Define Agents
user_agent = UserAgent(name="UserAgent", description="Request tasks and provide data.")
summarizer_agent = AssistantAgent(name="SummarizerAgent", description="Summarizes customer feedback.")
sentiment_agent = AssistantAgent(name="SentimentAgent", description="Analyzes sentiment in feedback.")

# Define Orchestration Workflow
dialogue = Dialogue(user_agent, summarizer_agent, sentiment_agent)

# User Task
task = """
Here is the customer feedback:
1. "The product is excellent, but shipping was delayed."
2. "Amazing quality! Will recommend to others."
3. "The customer service was unhelpful. Disappointed with the response."

Step 1: Summarize the overall feedback.
Step 2: Extract positive and negative sentiments.
"""

# Add Task to the Dialogue
dialogue.add_message(user_agent, task)

# Run the Orchestrated Workflow
response = dialogue.run()

# Print Responses
print("Orchestrated Agent Responses:")
for msg in response:
    print(f"{msg['agent']}: {msg['text']}")
```

---

### **Output**
```
Orchestrated Agent Responses:
SummarizerAgent: The feedback indicates that customers appreciate the product quality but are dissatisfied with shipping delays and customer service.
SentimentAgent: 
Positive Sentiments:
1. "The product is excellent."
2. "Amazing quality! Will recommend to others."

Negative Sentiments:
1. "Shipping was delayed."
2. "The customer service was unhelpful. Disappointed with the response."
```

---

### **How This Works**
1. **UserAgent**: Provides input and orchestrates tasks.
2. **SummarizerAgent**: Handles text summarization.
3. **SentimentAgent**: Analyzes sentiment in the feedback.
4. **Dialogue Framework**: Automatically manages task delegation and response integration.

---

### **Extending the Workflow**
You can expand this orchestration with:
- **ToolAgent**: Fetch external data (e.g., APIs or databases).
- **Custom Logic**: Implement decision-making based on agent outputs.
- **Multi-Step Interactions**: Agents communicate back and forth for more complex tasks.

---

### **Example: Adding a ToolAgent**
```python
from autogen import ToolAgent

# Define a Tool Agent for Additional Data
tool_agent = ToolAgent(
    name="DataFetcherAgent",
    description="Fetches customer feedback statistics.",
    tool_function=lambda query: {"positive_count": 2, "negative_count": 2}
)

# Add to Dialogue
dialogue_with_tool = Dialogue(user_agent, summarizer_agent, sentiment_agent, tool_agent)

# User Task with Tool Integration
task_with_tool = """
Summarize the feedback, analyze sentiment, and provide statistics on positive and negative feedback.
"""

dialogue_with_tool.add_message(user_agent, task_with_tool)
response_with_tool = dialogue_with_tool.run()

# Print Tool-Assisted Responses
print("With Tool Integration:")
for msg in response_with_tool:
    print(f"{msg['agent']}: {msg['text']}")
```

---

### **Sample Output with ToolAgent**
```
With Tool Integration:
SummarizerAgent: The feedback highlights excellent product quality but issues with shipping and customer service.
SentimentAgent: 
Positive Sentiments:
1. "The product is excellent."
2. "Amazing quality! Will recommend to others."

Negative Sentiments:
1. "Shipping was delayed."
2. "The customer service was unhelpful. Disappointed with the response."

DataFetcherAgent: Positive feedback count: 2. Negative feedback count: 2.
```

---

### **Applications**
- **Customer Support**: Analyze and prioritize feedback.
- **Claims Processing**: Split tasks between agents for text extraction, fraud detection, and recommendations.
- **Business Intelligence**: Summarize reports, analyze sentiments, and provide actionable insights.

By orchestrating agents in AutoGen, you can design scalable workflows that solve complex tasks efficiently and collaboratively.
