### üß± **AWS for Data Engineering**

#### ‚úÖ **1. Data Ingestion**

* **Amazon Kinesis / MSK (Kafka):** Real-time streaming ingestion.
* **AWS Glue / Lambda / DataSync / DMS:** Batch or migration pipelines.
* **Amazon S3:** Central data lake for raw and processed data.

#### ‚úÖ **2. Data Transformation & Orchestration**

* **AWS Glue** (ETL jobs using PySpark or Python shell)
* **Amazon EMR** (Apache Spark, Hive, Presto at scale)
* **AWS Step Functions / MWAA (Airflow):** Orchestration for complex workflows

#### ‚úÖ **3. Data Warehousing**

* **Amazon Redshift** for analytics & BI
* **Athena** for serverless querying over S3
* **Lake Formation** for secure, governed data lakes

### ü§ñ **AWS for Machine Learning**

#### ‚úÖ **1. Model Development**

* **Amazon SageMaker:**

  * Managed Jupyter notebooks
  * Built-in algorithms or custom training in containers
  * Automatic model tuning (Hyperparameter Optimization)
* **SageMaker JumpStart:** Pretrained models (NLP, vision, etc.)
* **SageMaker Experiments:** Track runs, metrics, models

#### ‚úÖ **2. Model Training**

* **Distributed training** on GPU clusters
* **Spot instances** to reduce training cost
* **SageMaker Pipelines:** End-to-end MLOps pipelines (data prep ‚Üí train ‚Üí deploy)

#### ‚úÖ **3. Model Deployment**

* **Real-time endpoints** (low-latency inference)
* **Batch transform** (offline inference)
* **SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoints / Serverless inference**

#### ‚úÖ **4. Monitoring & Governance**

* **Model Monitor:** Drift and bias detection
* **SageMaker Clarify:** Explainability
* **CloudWatch / SageMaker Model Registry:** Logging and version control

### üß† **How I Use AWS as a Data/ML Engineer**

> ‚ÄúI typically build pipelines where data lands in S3, is transformed using Glue or Spark on EMR, and then passed into SageMaker pipelines for training and evaluation. Models are deployed as endpoints with logging and monitoring enabled. We use Step Functions to orchestrate the entire flow.‚Äù

---

### üîê **Security & Compliance**

* **IAM roles & policies** to secure access across services.
* **KMS encryption**, **VPC integration**, **audit logging (CloudTrail)** for data protection and compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
