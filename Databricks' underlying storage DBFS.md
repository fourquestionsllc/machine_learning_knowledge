In **Databricks**, **underlying storage** refers to the actual physical storage layer where data is stored and accessed within the Databricks environment. Databricks itself is a platform for running Apache Spark jobs, data analytics, and machine learning tasks, but it relies on external storage systems to persist data. The **underlying storage** is where raw and processed data are stored, and it is abstracted through Databricks for seamless data processing and management.

### **Key Types of Underlying Storage in Databricks:**

1. **Cloud Storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake, Google Cloud Storage)**
   - **Amazon S3 (AWS)**: Databricks often uses **S3** as the storage layer for data. S3 is a highly scalable object storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Databricks integrates with S3 to read and write data efficiently.
   - **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: For Databricks running on **Azure**, **Azure Data Lake Storage** is commonly used as the storage backend. ADLS is optimized for big data workloads and is highly scalable, enabling high-performance data processing.
   - **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: For Databricks on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Google Cloud Storage** serves as the underlying storage system. It provides scalable, secure object storage.

2. **Databricks File System (DBFS)**
   - **DBFS** is a distributed file system provided by Databricks that acts as a **mounting point** to the cloud storage service (like S3, ADLS, or GCS). It abstracts the cloud storage, allowing users to interact with it as if it's a local filesystem.
   - DBFS can be used to store notebooks, libraries, and data files. It provides an interface for mounting external storage to Databricks so that users can interact with files stored in cloud storage from within the Databricks environment.

3. **Delta Lake Storage**
   - **Delta Lake** is a storage layer built on top of cloud object storage (such as S3, ADLS, or GCS) and integrates with Databricks. It brings **ACID transactions** to big data workloads, which allows for **consistent and reliable data** with support for **schema evolution**, **time travel**, and **versioning**.
   - **Delta Lake** improves data reliability and enables better performance by providing **metadata management** and **transaction logs**. It is particularly useful for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data that needs to be processed efficiently.

4. **Managed Tables (Databricks Managed Delta Tables)**
   - Databricks allows you to store data in **managed tables**, where the system manages both the metadata and data storage. When using Delta Lake, **managed tables** are stored and maintained by Databricks, and the underlying data is automatically managed by the platform.
   - **External Tables**: These are tables that reference data stored externally (in external storage like S3, ADLS) without moving the data into Databricks-managed storage.

### **Databricks' Integration with Cloud Storage:**
Databricks integrates deeply with the cloud storage solutions offered by the cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). The data storage on these platforms is highly scalable, cost-effective, and optimized for big data workloads. By integrating with these systems, Databricks enables users to perform distributed data processing and analytics efficiently.

### **How Databricks Uses Underlying Storage:**

- **Read/Write Operations**: When you run Spark jobs or Databricks notebooks, the data is read from and written to these underlying storage systems. Whether you're working with raw data, intermediate processing, or output results, your data interactions (queries, ETL processes) are done through these cloud-based storage services.
  
- **Delta Lake**: Delta Lake storage allows for better optimization of reads and writes with features like **ACID transactions**, **schema evolution**, and **time travel** (which lets you query historical data).
  
- **Data Frames**: When you use Spark DataFrames in Databricks, you're interacting with data stored in the underlying storage, whether it's Delta Lake or cloud storage (e.g., S3 or ADLS).
  
- **External Storage Mounting**: Databricks provides the ability to **mount** external cloud storage locations (like S3 or ADLS) to the Databricks workspace using DBFS, making it easy to access data stored in the cloud from within the Databricks environment.

### **Summary of Underlying Storage in Databricks:**
- **Cloud storage services** (S3, ADLS, GCS) serve as the primary underlying storage for Databricks.
- **DBFS** is a virtualized file system that provides access to cloud storage through Databricks.
- **Delta Lake** is a storage layer built on top of cloud storage, providing ACID transactions and optimized data processing capabilities.
  
Databricks' underlying storage provides the necessary infrastructure to support big data processing, ensuring high scalability, reliability, and performance in cloud-based environments.
