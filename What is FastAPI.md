### ⚙️ **Key Features**

| Feature                   | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fast**                  | Built on Starlette + Uvicorn; faster than Flask due to async support  |
| **Async Support**         | Native `async/await` makes it suitable for high-concurrency workloads |
| **Type-Hinting**          | Uses Python 3.6+ type hints for validation, serialization, and docs   |
| **Auto Docs**             | Generates OpenAPI + Swagger UI automatically from your code           |
| **Validation**            | Built-in request/response validation using **Pydantic**               |
| **Modular & Lightweight** | Can be used for small apps, or as a microservice backend              |
| **Great Dev Experience**  | Clear error messages, auto-complete in IDEs, minimal boilerplate      |

### 📦 Tech Stack Behind FastAPI

* **Starlette** – Web framework for ASGI apps (routing, middleware, sessions)
* **Uvicorn** – ASGI server for running FastAPI apps
* **Pydantic** – Data parsing, validation, and serialization

---

### 🚀 Use Cases

* Building RESTful APIs or microservices
* Backend for ML models (e.g., expose LLMs or prediction endpoints)
* Real-time apps with WebSockets
* Lightweight alternatives to Flask/Django for API-only services

---

### 🧠 Code Example: ML Inference API with FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import joblib

app = FastAPI()

# Load ML model
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")

class Input(BaseModel):
    feature1: float
    feature2: float

@app.post("/predict")
def predict(data: Input):
    pred = model.predict([[data.feature1, data.feature2]])
    return {"prediction": pred[0]}
```

> Automatically gets Swagger docs at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### ✅ Interview Summary Answer

> “FastAPI is a fast, type-safe Python web framework optimized for APIs. I’ve used it to deploy ML models as REST endpoints, thanks to its async support, built-in validation via Pydantic, and automatic Swagger docs — which makes it a great fit for production ML and GenAI services.”
