Here is a comparison of **Transformers** vs **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and their differences:

---

### 1. **Transformers**  
   - **Definition**: Transformers are deep learning architectures designed for sequential data using **self-attention mechanisms**.  
   - **Primary Use**: NLP tasks (language modeling, translation, chatbots) and recently in vision tasks (e.g., Vision Transformers).  

#### Key Features:  
- **Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, regardless of distance.  
- **Parallelization**: All tokens are processed in parallel, making Transformers efficient on large datasets.  
- **Long-Range Dependencies**: Easily captures relationships across long sequences, unlike RNNs or CNNs.  
- **Architecture**: Multi-head attention, position-wise feed-forward layers, and positional encodings.  
- **Scalability**: Large-scale models like GPT and BERT have billions of parameters.  

#### Strengths:  
- Excellent for **sequential tasks** (NLP, text).  
- Superior for **long-range dependencies**.  
- Parallelizable training due to attention mechanisms.

#### Weaknesses:  
- Computationally expensive for very long sequences.  
- Requires more data and computational power compared to CNNs.

### 2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
   - **Definition**: CNNs use **convolutional layers** to process grid-like data (images, time-series).  
   - **Primary Use**: Image recognition, object detection, image segmentation, and some sequence tasks.  

#### Key Features:  
- **Local Receptive Fields**: Convolutions operate over small regions (kernels), focusing on local spatial features.  
- **Weight Sharing**: The same filter (kernel) is applied across the input to detect specific features.  
- **Pooling**: Reduces dimensionality and computational load while retaining important features.  
- **Spatial Hierarchies**: Captures low-level details (edges) in early layers and high-level semantics in later layers.

#### Strengths:  
- Highly efficient for **spatial data** (images).  
- Lower computational cost compared to Transformers for smaller datasets.  
- Strong inductive biases for images (local features).  

#### Weaknesses:  
- Struggles to capture **long-range dependencies** due to small receptive fields.  
- Sequential processing (e.g., in text) is less efficient compared to Transformers.

### **Use Cases**  
1. **Transformers**:  
   - Language modeling (GPT, BERT, T5).  
   - Machine translation.  
   - Vision Transformers (ViT) for images.  

2. **CNNs**:
