# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)

This guide provides an overview of hyperparameters for LLMs and demonstrates how to fine-tune these models using Python code.

## Hyperparameters of LLMs

### **Training Hyperparameters**
1. **Learning Rate**: Controls how much the model weights are adjusted during each training step.
2. **Batch Size**: The number of samples processed before updating the model.
3. **Epochs**: The number of complete passes through the training dataset.
4. **Weight Decay**: A regularization parameter to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights.
5. **Warmup Steps**: The number of steps for the learning rate to increase linearly before decaying.
6. **Gradient Clipping**: Limits the gradient values to avoid exploding gradients.

### **Model Hyperparameters**
1. **Number of Layers**: Controls the depth of the transformer network.
2. **Number of Attention Heads**: Determines the granularity of attention mechanisms.
3. **Hidden Size**: The dimensionality of the model's hidden states.
4. **Dropout Rate**: Adds noise to prevent overfitting by randomly zeroing activations during training.
5. **Vocabulary Size**: Size of the tokenizer vocabulary.

## Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters

Fine-tuning adjusts a pretrained LLM to a specific task using smaller, task-specific datasets. Common fine-tuning hyperparameters include:
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Epochs
- Optimizer type (e.g., AdamW)
- Scheduler type (e.g., linear decay)

### **Setup**
Install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install transformers datasets accelerate
