When comparing open-source SQL databases based on their support for User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and built-in functions, **PostgreSQL** stands out as the most feature-rich option. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **PostgreSQL**

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Built-in Functions**: 
   - Extensive support for mathematical, string, date/time, and aggregate functions.
   - Advanced features like window functions, recursive queries (using `WITH RECURSIVE`), and JSON/JSONB manipulation.
   
2. **UDF Support in Multiple Languages**:
   - Native support for creating functions in **PL/pgSQL**.
   - Supports other languages via extensions, such as **PL/Python**, **PL/Perl**, and **PL/R**.
   - Advanced integration with procedural languages enables flexible and complex UDFs.

3. **Extensions Ecosystem**:
   - Extensions like `PostGIS` (for geospatial data) and `pg_trgm` (for trigram similarity) enhance functionality significantly.
   - Custom extensions can further extend UDF capabilities.

4. **Complex Data Types and Functions**:
   - Works natively with arrays, JSON, ranges, hstore, and composite types.
   - Offers a rich set of functions for manipulating these data types.

**When to Use**: Choose PostgreSQL if your use case requires advanced functions, flexibility, or significant extensibility through UDFs.

### **MySQL (and MariaDB)**

**Strengths:**
1. **Basic Built-in Functions**:
   - Includes core functions for string, numeric, date/time, and JSON operations.
   - JSON functionality is less powerful compared to PostgreSQL.

2. **UDFs**:
   - Supports custom UDFs written in C or C++.
   - Adding UDFs is more challenging compared to PostgreSQL because it requires compiled shared libraries.

3. **MariaDB Extensions**:
   - As a fork of MySQL, MariaDB offers additional features like more JSON functions, and window functions, bringing it closer to PostgreSQL's level of functionality.

**When to Use**: MySQL or MariaDB is suitable for simpler use cases or when performance optimizations for read-heavy workloads are the priority.

### **Other Options**

#### **SQLite**
- **Strengths**: Lightweight and embeddable, with support for defining UDFs in external programming languages like Python or C.
- **Weaknesses**: Lacks the breadth of built-in functions found in PostgreSQL or MySQL. Best for lightweight, single-user applications.

#### **DuckDB**
- **Strengths**: Emerging analytics-oriented database with powerful SQL capabilities and some advanced functions.
- **Weaknesses**: Not as mature or feature-complete in terms of UDF support as PostgreSQL.

#### **ClickHouse**
- **Strengths**: Optimized for analytics and fast queries, with some UDF support through external code.
- **Weaknesses**: Focused more on analytics and less on general-purpose SQL functions.

#### **TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL-based)**
- **Strengths**: Built on PostgreSQL and inherits all its UDF and function capabilities while adding time-series specific functionality.

### **Conclusion**

| Feature                     | PostgreSQL            | MySQL/MariaDB           | SQLite                | DuckDB/ClickHouse       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Built-in Functions          | ðŸ¥‡ Richest           | Moderate               | Limited               | Specialized            |
| UDF Languages               | Multiple (e.g., PL/pgSQL, PL/Python) | C/C++ Only            | C/Python              | Limited                |
| Extensibility via Extensions| Excellent (e.g., PostGIS) | Moderate (MariaDB better) | Minimal               | Growing                |
| JSON/Array Support          | Excellent            | Good                   | Limited               | Moderate               |

PostgreSQL is the clear winner for a feature-rich SQL database, especially for advanced UDF capabilities and a rich ecosystem of extensions.
