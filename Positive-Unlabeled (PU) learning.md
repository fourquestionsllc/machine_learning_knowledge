What you're describing is a **Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning** problem. Since you only have positive samples and a large set of unlabeled samples (which may contain both positive and negative instances), you need a special approach to train a machine learning model effectively.

Here’s a general approach to solve this problem:

---

### **Step 1: Prepare the Data**
- **Positive Set (P):** The labeled positive examples you have.
- **Unlabeled Set (U):** The rest of the data (contains both positive and negative examples, but you don’t know which is which).

---

### **Step 2: Use a PU Learning Method**
There are three main ways to approach PU learning:

#### **1. Two-Step Approach (Traditional PU Learning)**
1. **Step 1: Identify Reliable Negatives**
   - Train a basic classifier (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, random forest) treating all **U samples as negative**.
   - The samples in **U that are confidently classified as negative** are considered the "reliable negative" set.
   
2. **Step 2: Train a Standard Classifier**
   - Now, with **P (positives)** and **reliable negatives**, train a traditional binary classifier.
   - Use this classifier to predict other positive samples in the unlabeled set.

---

#### **2. Class-Prior Estimation & Reweighting (Unbiased PU Learning)**
This method directly modifies the loss function to account for the missing labels:
- Assume some fraction \(\pi\) of the unlabeled samples are actually positive.
- Use **risk estimation** techniques (such as non-negative risk estimators) to adjust for the missing negatives.
- Train a standard classifier (e.g., neural network, SVM) but modify the loss function to treat **unlabeled data with reweighted labels**.

This is a more statistically rigorous approach but can be harder to implement.

---

#### **3. Positive-Unlabeled GANs or Self-Learning Methods**
- **Self-learning:** Start with a classifier trained on **P vs. U (as negatives)** and iteratively re-label high-confidence samples.
- **PU-GANs:** Use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic negatives and train a robust classifier.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate the Model**
Since you don’t have true negatives, use:
- **Precision-Recall Curves** (instead of accuracy).
- **Estimate class prior** and check consistency with real-world data.

### **Popular Libraries for PU Learning**
- `PULearning` in Python (scikit-learn compatible)
- `pulearn` (for biased SVM)
- Implementations in PyTorch/TensorFlow for deep learning-based methods.
