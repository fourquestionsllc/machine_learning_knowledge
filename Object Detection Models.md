Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, and several models have been developed to detect objects within images or videos. These models vary in terms of accuracy, speed, and computational efficiency. The most popular object detection models are:

1. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  
2. **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)**  
3. **Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)**  
4. **RetinaNet**  
5. **EfficientDet**  
6. **Detectron2**  
7. **CenterNet**  

Let's compare these models in terms of key aspects like speed, accuracy, and ease of use.

   **Speed vs. Accuracy**:
   - EfficientDet offers a great trade-off between speed and accuracy, particularly when low computational power is a consideration.

### 6. **Detectron2**
   - **Type**: Two-stage detector.
   - **Overview**: Detectron2 is an open-source framework developed by Facebook AI Research for object detection tasks. It includes implementations for several state-of-the-art models, including Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Mask R-CNN (which handles instance segmentation).
   - **Strengths**:
     - Highly modular and flexible.
     - State-of-the-art accuracy with support for many advanced techniques (e.g., instance segmentation).
   - **Weaknesses**:
     - High computational cost.
     - Requires strong hardware (e.g., GPUs) for real-time performance.
   - **Use Case**: Complex tasks such as object detection and segmentation in research, autonomous driving, and other high-accuracy applications.

   **Speed vs. Accuracy**:
   - While Detectron2 excels in accuracy, it is slower compared to YOLO and SSD due to its more complex models and processes.

### 7. **CenterNet**
   - **Type**: Single-stage detector.
