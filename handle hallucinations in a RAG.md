> **“Hallucination happens when the LLM generates information not grounded in the retrieved context or external truth. I handle it through a combination of retrieval improvements, response filtering, and model prompting strategies. Here's my multi-layered approach:”**

---

### ✅ **1. Improve Retrieval Quality**

> *Hallucinations often stem from poor or missing context.*

* **Dense and hybrid retrieval**

  * Combine vector + keyword search (e.g., BM25 + embeddings).
* **Metadata filtering / reranking**

  * Filter by date, source, or tags; rerank using cross-encoder or LLM-based scoring.
* **Chunking strategy**

  * Use semantic or hierarchical chunking to avoid cut-off information or ambiguity.
* **Top-k tuning**

  * Increase `k` to bring in more potentially relevant chunks, then rerank.

---

### ✅ **2. Prompt Engineering**

> *Shape the LLM’s behavior to stick to source content.*

* **Explicit grounding instructions**

  ```text
  “Answer strictly based on the provided context. If not found, say 'Not enough information.'”
  ```
* **Chain-of-thought prompting**

  * Ask the model to reason step-by-step using the context before forming an answer.
* **System prompt setup**

  * In structured agents (like OpenAI function calls or CrewAI), provide a strict system role to force fact-based behavior.

---

### ✅ **3. Post-Generation Filtering / Validation**

> *Filter or score the answer after it’s generated.*

* **LLM-based Fact Checking**

  * Ask GPT-4 or Claude: “Is this answer fully supported by the retrieved context?”
* **Use `RAGAS` or `TruLens`**

  * Automatically score “faithfulness” and reject or flag low-confidence responses.
* **Answer citation linking**

  * Link each part of the answer to specific context chunks — enables easier trust and traceability.

```python
# Example: RAGAS faithfulness eval
from ragas import evaluate
evaluate(predictions=[...], metrics=["faithfulness", "context_precision"])
```

---

### ✅ **4. Retrieval Failure Handling**

> *When nothing useful is retrieved, don’t hallucinate.*

* **Null / fallback responses**

  * “I don’t have enough information to answer that.”
* **Trigger re-retrieval**

  * If the LLM detects insufficient context, it can ask the retriever to fetch again with reformulated query.

---

### ✅ **5. Agent-Based Safeguards (Optional)**

> *Use multi-agent setups to review and critique answers.*

* **Critic agents** (e.g., in AutoGen, CrewAI)

  * One agent writes the answer, another checks for hallucinations.
* **Fact-check chain**

  * Generate → fact-check → revise

| Technique                    | Layer               | Impact                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Hybrid retrieval             | Retrieval           | Brings better grounding data |
| “Stick to context” prompt    | Prompting           | Reduces speculative output   |
| LLM-based faithfulness check | Post-gen eval       | Filters unsupported answers  |
| Critic agents                | Agent orchestration | Adds reasoning safety        |
| “No answer” fallback         | UX / Control        | Avoids misleading answers    |
