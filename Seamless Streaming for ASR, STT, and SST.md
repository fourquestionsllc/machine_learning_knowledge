SeamlessStreaming is a multilingual streaming translation model developed by Meta, supporting:

- **Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Transcribes speech in real-time across 96 languages.

- **Simultaneous Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT)**: Translates spoken language into text in real-time, supporting 101 source languages and 96 target languages.

- **Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST)**: Translates spoken language into another spoken language in real-time, supporting 36 target languages.

The model is designed for applications requiring low-latency, real-time translation, such as live broadcasts, multilingual meetings, and interactive voice response systems.

**Using SeamlessStreaming**

To utilize SeamlessStreaming, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment**:

   Ensure you have Python 3.8 and the necessary dependencies installed. It's recommended to use a GPU for optimal performance.

   ```bash
   # Create a conda environment
   conda create --yes --name smlss_server python=3.8 libsndfile==1.0.31
   conda activate smlss_server

   # Install PyTorch with CUDA support
   conda install --yes pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

   # Install Fairseq2
   pip install fairseq2 --pre --extra-index-url https://fair.pkg.atmeta.com/fairseq2/whl/nightly/pt2.1.1/cu118

   # Install additional requirements
   pip install -r seamless_server/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set Up the Frontend**:

   Install Node.js and the required frontend dependencies.

   ```bash
   # Install Node.js
   conda install -c conda-forge nodejs

   # Navigate to the frontend directory
   cd streaming-react-app

   # Install Yarn package manager
   npm install --global yarn

   # Install dependencies and build the frontend
   yarn
   yarn build  # This will create the dist/ folder
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:

   Start the backend server using Uvicorn.

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the server directory
   cd seamless_server

   # Run the server in development mode
   uvicorn app_pubsub:app --reload --host localhost

   # For production mode
   uvicorn app_pubsub:app --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:

   Once the server is running, you can access the application through your web browser. If running locally, navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

**Example Code for Speech-to-Text Translation**

Here's an example of how to use SeamlessStreaming for speech-to-text translation:

```python
import torch
from fairseq2 import SeamlessStreamingModel

# Load the SeamlessStreaming model
model = SeamlessStreamingModel.from_pretrained('facebook/seamless-streaming')

# Prepare the audio input (ensure it's in the correct format)
audio_input = 'path_to_audio_file.wav'

# Perform speech-to-text translation
translation = model.transcribe(audio_input, src_lang='en', tgt_lang='fr')

# Output the translation
print(translation)
```

This script loads the SeamlessStreaming model, processes an audio file, and outputs the translated text from English to French.
