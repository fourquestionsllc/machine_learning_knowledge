**RESTful APIs vs. GraphQL** ‚Äî Here's a clear comparison to help you understand the differences and when to use each.

## üåê **1. Basics**

| Feature      | RESTful API                             | GraphQL                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Protocol     | HTTP-based with predefined endpoints    | HTTP-based but uses a single endpoint |
| Data Format  | JSON (or XML)                           | JSON                                  |
| Request Type | Multiple endpoints (`/users`, `/posts`) | Single endpoint (e.g., `/graphql`)    |

## üì¶ **2. Data Fetching**

| Feature                      | RESTful API                       | GraphQL                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-fetching/Under-fetching | Common (fixed response structure) | Solved (client defines the shape of the response) |
| Query Flexibility            | Low                               | High                                              |
| Batching                     | Requires custom handling          | Built-in support via query nesting                |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **3. Operations**

| Feature                | RESTful API                              | GraphQL                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| CRUD Style             | Mapped to HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT‚Ä¶) | All handled via POST with query/mutation |
| Versioning             | Done via URI or headers (`/v1/users`)    | Typically avoided (schemas evolve)       |
| Filtering & Pagination | Requires custom parameters               | Schema-based, more consistent            |

## üîê **4. Security & Performance**

| Feature       | RESTful API                      | GraphQL                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Caching       | Easy with HTTP caching headers   | Requires manual caching (e.g., Apollo Cache) |
| Security      | Straightforward (endpoint-based) | Needs depth limiting, query complexity rules |
| Rate Limiting | Per endpoint                     | Per query or field (more granular)           |

## üß∞ **5. Tooling & Ecosystem**

| Feature           | RESTful API                       | GraphQL                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Tooling           | Mature (Postman, Swagger/OpenAPI) | Growing (Apollo, GraphiQL, GraphQL Voyager) |
| Learning Curve    | Easier for beginners              | Steeper but more flexible                   |
| Community Support | Very large                        | Rapidly growing                             |

## üöÄ **6. When to Use What**

### ‚úÖ Use **REST** when:

* You have simple, resource-based APIs.
* You need easy caching, logging, and monitoring.
* Your client needs a predictable, fixed response.
* You're integrating with many 3rd-party systems expecting REST.

### ‚úÖ Use **GraphQL** when:

* You want to avoid over-fetching/under-fetching.
* Your frontend needs flexible queries (especially for mobile or SPAs).
* You want a single endpoint for complex relationships.
* You‚Äôre building modern apps where schema evolution is key.

## üß† TL;DR

| REST                                 | GraphQL                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Multiple endpoints, fixed data       | Single endpoint, flexible data |
| Simpler, well-established            | Complex, powerful, modern      |
| Great for public APIs, microservices | Great for frontend-heavy apps  |
