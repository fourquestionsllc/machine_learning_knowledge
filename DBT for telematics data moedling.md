Using **dbt (Data Build Tool)** for data modeling in a **telematics** context (e.g., at a company like GEICO) involves transforming raw data into analytics-ready tables in a structured, scalable, and maintainable way. Let's walk through a **detailed end-to-end process** with examples and realistic SQL code to model telematics data such as trips, driving behavior, GPS, and vehicle diagnostics.

---

## 🧭 Overview: Telematics Modeling Goals

For a company like GEICO, telematics data might come from vehicles and includes:

- **GPS Data** (lat/long, timestamp)
- **Trip Info** (start time, end time, distance)
- **Driving Behavior** (harsh braking, acceleration)
- **Vehicle Diagnostics** (battery, tire pressure)
- **User Metadata** (policyholder, vehicle info)

Using `dbt`, you typically:
1. Ingest and stage raw data
2. Clean/standardize it in staging models
3. Build intermediate models (marts) for business logic
4. Aggregate for analytics or ML

---

## 🏗️ Project Setup

### 1. Create a dbt project

```bash
dbt init geico_telematics
cd geico_telematics
```

Update `dbt_project.yml` with project info and set `"models": {"geico_telematics": {"+materialized": "view"}}`.

## 🧾 Example Raw Tables

Let’s assume the following raw tables in your warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery):

- `raw.telematics_gps`
- `raw.trip_data`
- `raw.vehicle_info`
- `raw.driving_events`
- `raw.user_profiles`

---

## 2️⃣ Staging Models

Normalize and rename columns, handle nulls, parse types.

### `models/staging/stg_gps.sql`

```sql
{{ config(materialized='view') }}

with source as (
    select * from {{ source('raw', 'telematics_gps') }}
),

renamed as (
    select
        device_id,
        cast(timestamp as timestamp) as gps_timestamp,
        latitude,
        longitude,
        speed_kmh
    from source
)

select * from renamed
```

### `models/staging/stg_trip.sql`

```sql
with source as (
    select * from {{ source('raw', 'trip_data') }}
),

cleaned as (
    select
        trip_id,
        user_id,
        device_id,
        cast(start_time as timestamp) as start_time,
        cast(end_time as timestamp) as end_time,
        distance_km
    from source
)

select * from cleaned
```

---

## 3️⃣ Intermediate / Business Logic Models

Join GPS + Trip to calculate average speed, trip duration, and link behavioral flags.

### `models/marts/int_trip_behavior.sql`

```sql
with trip as (
    select * from {{ ref('stg_trip') }}
),

gps as (
    select * from {{ ref('stg_gps') }}
),

trip_gps as (
    select
        t.trip_id,
        t.user_id,
        min(g.gps_timestamp) as first_gps,
        max(g.gps_timestamp) as last_gps,
        datediff('second', min(g.gps_timestamp), max(g.gps_timestamp)) as trip_duration_sec,
        t.distance_km,
        t.device_id
    from trip t
    join gps g on t.device_id = g.device_id
        and g.gps_timestamp between t.start_time and t.end_time
    group by t.trip_id, t.user_id, t.distance_km, t.device_id
)

select *,
       (distance_km / (trip_duration_sec / 3600.0)) as avg_speed_kmh
from trip_gps
```

---

## 4️⃣ Final Mart: Driver Behavior Summary

Aggregate driver events like harsh braking, acceleration.

### `models/marts/fct_driver_behavior.sql`

```sql
with events as (
    select * from {{ source('raw', 'driving_events') }}
),

summary as (
    select
        user_id,
        count(case when event_type = 'harsh_brake' then 1 end) as harsh_brakes,
        count(case when event_type = 'rapid_acceleration' then 1 end) as rapid_accels,
        count(*) as total_events
    from events
    group by user_id
)

select * from summary
```

---

## 5️⃣ Dimension Table: Vehicles

### `models/marts/dim_vehicle.sql`

```sql
with vehicles as (
    select * from {{ source('raw', 'vehicle_info') }}
)

select
    vehicle_id,
    vin,
    make,
    model,
    year,
    vehicle_type
from vehicles
```

---

## ✅ Testing

Add tests for nulls, uniqueness, referential integrity.

### `models/staging/stg_trip.yml`

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_trip
    columns:
      - name: trip_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: user_id
        tests:
          - not_null
```

---

## 📊 Use Case: Analyze Safe Drivers

You can now write a model to find safest drivers:

```sql
with behavior as (
    select * from {{ ref('fct_driver_behavior') }}
)

select
    user_id,
    total_events,
    harsh_brakes,
    rapid_accels,
    case
        when harsh_brakes = 0 and rapid_accels = 0 then 'safe'
        when harsh_brakes < 3 and rapid_accels < 3 then 'moderate'
        else 'risky'
    end as driver_risk_category
from behavior
```

---

## 🏁 Run the Pipeline

```bash
# Compile and run everything
dbt run

# Test your models
dbt test

# Generate docs
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

---

## 🧠 Optional: dbt Sources

In `models/schema.yml`, define raw tables as sources.

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw
    tables:
      - name: telematics_gps
      - name: trip_data
      - name: driving_events
      - name: vehicle_info
```

---

## 🚀 Bonus Ideas

- Add a `snapshot` to track vehicle info changes over time
- Use `dbt-expectations` for complex tests
- Schedule with Airflow or dbt Cloud
- Integrate with ML scoring models
