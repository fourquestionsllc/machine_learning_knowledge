MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging code, and deploying models. MLflow consists of four main components, each offering specific functions:

### 1. **MLflow Tracking**
   - **`mlflow.start_run()`**: Starts a new MLflow run for tracking parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
   - **`mlflow.log_param(key, value)`**: Logs a single parameter.
   - **`mlflow.log_params(params)`**: Logs multiple parameters.
   - **`mlflow.log_metric(key, value, step=None)`**: Logs a single metric with an optional step.
   - **`mlflow.log_metrics(metrics, step=None)`**: Logs multiple metrics.
   - **`mlflow.log_artifact(local_path, artifact_path=None)`**: Logs a local file as an artifact.
   - **`mlflow.log_artifacts(local_dir, artifact_path=None)`**: Logs all files in a local directory as artifacts.
   - **`mlflow.set_tag(key, value)`**: Sets a tag for the run.
   - **`mlflow.get_run(run_id)`**: Retrieves a run by its ID.
   - **`mlflow.end_run()`**: Ends the current run.

---

### 2. **MLflow Projects**
   - **`mlflow.run()`**: Runs an MLflow project from a URI (local directory, Git repository, or remote storage).
   - **`mlflow.projects.run(uri, parameters=None, ... )`**: Executes the specified project with parameters.
   - MLflow Projects are packaged in a standardized directory structure, typically including a `MLproject` file.

---

### 3. **MLflow Models**
   - **`mlflow.pyfunc.save_model()`**: Saves a model in the MLflow "pyfunc" format.
   - **`mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()`**: Loads a "pyfunc" model.
   - **`mlflow.log_model()`**: Logs a model to the current run.
   - **`mlflow.models.register_model()`**: Registers a model with the MLflow Model Registry.
   - **`mlflow.models.transition_model_stage()`**: Transitions a model between stages (e.g., from "Staging" to "Production").
   - **`mlflow.models.predict()`**: Runs inference using a deployed model.

---

### 4. **MLflow Model Registry**
   - **`mlflow.register_model()`**: Registers a model to the MLflow Model Registry.
   - **`mlflow.get_model_version()`**: Fetches details about a specific version of a model.
   - **`mlflow.transition_model_version_stage()`**: Moves a model version to a different stage (e.g., staging, production).
   - **`mlflow.delete_model_version()`**: Deletes a specific version of a model.
   - **`mlflow.search_registered_models()`**: Searches for registered models.

---

### 5. **MLflow CLI**
   - MLflow also provides a command-line interface (CLI) for operations like starting runs, listing experiments, and serving models.

---

### 6. **Utilities**
   - **`mlflow.set_experiment()`**: Sets the active experiment for the run.
   - **`mlflow.get_artifact_uri()`**: Gets the URI for the artifact storage location.
   - **`mlflow.autolog()`**: Enables automatic logging for supported libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.

These functions make MLflow a versatile platform for managing all aspects of the machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation to deployment.
