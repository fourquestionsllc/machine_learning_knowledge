### üî∑ **1. TensorFlow**

> **‚ÄúTensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google, widely used in both research and production for building scalable ML models.‚Äù**

* Developed by: Google
* Language: Python (with C++ backend)
* Core Features:

  * Graph-based computation (TF 1.x), eager execution (TF 2.x)
  * Strong ecosystem: `TensorBoard`, `TF Lite`, `TF Serving`, `TF Hub`
  * Scalable deployment: mobile, edge (via TFLite), server (via TF Serving)
  * Production-focused (especially with `TF Extended` and `Vertex AI`)

---

### üî∑ **2. Keras**

> **‚ÄúKeras is a high-level API for building neural networks, integrated tightly with TensorFlow since TF 2.0, known for its simplicity and ease of use.‚Äù**

* Originally developed as an independent project (by Fran√ßois Chollet)
* Now part of TensorFlow (`tf.keras`)
* Focus: rapid prototyping, minimal boilerplate, intuitive layer-based design
* Not a full framework ‚Äî it's an **API** built on top of TensorFlow (or Theano/others historically)

---

### üî∑ **3. PyTorch**

> **‚ÄúPyTorch is a flexible and intuitive deep learning framework developed by Facebook, popular in research and now widely adopted in production too.‚Äù**

* Developed by: Meta (Facebook)
* Language: Python-first with dynamic computation graphs
* Core Features:

  * Dynamic computation (define-by-run model, easier debugging)
  * Strong support for NLP (used by HuggingFace)
  * Increasing production features: `TorchScript`, `TorchServe`, `ONNX` export
  * Widely used in research and academia due to flexibility and Pythonic design
