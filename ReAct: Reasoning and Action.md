**ReAct** in LLMs refers to a framework that combines **Reasoning** and **Action** to improve decision-making and task-solving capabilities. It enables the model to interact with external tools, gather intermediate information, and iteratively refine outputs.  

ReAct was introduced to address tasks where models need to:  
1. **Reason**: Break down problems logically.  
2. **Act**: Perform specific actions, such as calling APIs, querying data, or taking steps in a simulated environment.

### **How ReAct Works**  

The ReAct framework combines:  
1. **Reasoning**: The model provides thought processes or intermediate steps (chain-of-thought reasoning).  
2. **Actions**: The model executes actions like querying an API, searching, or interacting with a tool.  
3. **Observations**: Results from the action are provided as feedback to refine the reasoning and next actions.

This cycle continues iteratively:  
**Reason → Act → Observe → Repeat**

### **Structure of ReAct in Prompts**  

ReAct prompts involve:  
1. **Thought**: The model explains its reasoning.  
2. **Action**: The model decides on an action to perform.  
3. **Observation**: Results from the action are fed back into the reasoning process.

### **Example of ReAct Prompt in Action**  

**Task**: Find the current weather in New York.

**Prompt (ReAct)**:  
1. **Thought**: "I need to get the current weather information for New York. I will query a weather API."  
2. **Action**: `query_weather_api("New York")`  
3. **Observation**: "The weather in New York is 75°F, sunny."  
4. **Thought**: "Now that I have the weather, I can provide the answer."  
5. **Final Response**: "The current weather in New York is 75°F and sunny."

### **Why ReAct is Useful**  
- **Tool Integration**: Enables LLMs to interact with external tools like APIs, databases, or search engines.  
- **Dynamic Problem-Solving**: Allows the model to reason, take actions, and refine solutions iteratively.  
- **Improved Reasoning**: Combines **chain-of-thought reasoning** with actionable steps to solve complex tasks.

### **Applications of ReAct**  
- **Tool-augmented LLMs**: Integrating tools like search engines, calculators, or APIs.  
- **Question Answering**: Using intermediate reasoning to fetch accurate answers.  
- **Automated Workflows**: Solving multi-step problems that require reasoning and actions.

**ReAct** is widely used in frameworks like **LangChain** and **OpenAI agents**, where LLMs are empowered to interact with tools and environments in an iterative, reasoning-driven manner.
