When you send a prompt to ChatGPT (or any GPT model), here's a high-level breakdown of how it is processed:

1. **Prompt Input**:  
   - You type a question, request, or command (this is called a *prompt*).  
   - This prompt can include text, context, or special instructions.

2. **Tokenization**:  
   - The input text is split into smaller units called *tokens*.  
   - Tokens are essentially chunks of words or characters that the model understands. For example, "hello" is one token, but "artificial" could be split into multiple tokens depending on the language model's tokenizer.  
   - The model processes the tokens numerically, as it works on numbers, not plain text.

3. **Context Processing**:  
   - The model uses the tokens to understand the context, intent, and meaning of your input.  
   - The input and the conversation history are analyzed together (this is especially important for chat models like GPT that maintain dialogue context).  
   - The model identifies patterns, relationships, and likely outputs based on its training data.

4. **Computation in the Neural Network**:  
   - The GPT model processes your input using its neural network. This network has billions of parameters trained on massive amounts of text data.  
   - The model predicts the next likely tokens (words or phrases) to generate a coherent response.  
   - Each layer of the network refines the response further based on probabilities and relationships between words.

5. **Response Generation**:  
   - The model generates a response token-by-token based on likelihood.  
   - It does not "know" or "think" in a traditional sense but predicts the most likely output based on patterns it has seen in training.  
   - The output is converted back into human-readable text.

6. **Output to You**:  
   - The response is sent back to you in the form of text.  
   - If the conversation continues, the model uses the previous context to inform the next interaction.

In short:  
**Prompt → Tokenization → Context Analysis → Neural Network Computation → Response Generation → Output to User**.
